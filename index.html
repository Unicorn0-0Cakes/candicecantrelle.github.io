      <h2>// What I Offer</h2>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>💼 AI-Driven Simulation Design</h3>
        <p>Imagine bringing your complex ideas to life with dynamic AI simulations. I can help you develop bespoke virtual environments where digital organisms evolve or intricate systems unfold in real-time. Whether you're in gaming looking for emergent narratives, in education seeking engaging learning tools, or in research needing to model complex phenomena, I'll use my expertise in neural networks and procedural generation to build insightful and interactive simulations tailored to your specific needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>🤓 Facial Emotion Detection Solutions</h3>
        <p>Understanding user engagement and emotional response can be key to your project's success. I can develop or customize advanced facial emotion detection systems that provide valuable insights for user experience research, help create more empathetic mental health tools, or power compelling interactive installations. Let me help you tap into a deeper understanding of your audience.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>👁️ Computer Vision Applications</h3>
        <p>Need to make sense of the visual world? I build custom computer vision models that can recognize specific objects, classify images, or even read text from images, like my street number recognition systems. Whether you have a unique dataset or a specific visual challenge, I can tailor a solution that extracts the information you need, efficiently and accurately.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>🤝 AI & UX Integration Consulting</h3>
        <p>AI is powerful, but it's most effective when seamlessly integrated with a great user experience. With my dual expertise in AI development and human-centered UX design (certified by MIT, IBM, and Google), I'll help you bridge that gap. I'll consult with you to ensure your AI solutions not only work brilliantly but also enhance usability, delight your users, and meet your business goals.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>🌐 Interactive AI-Powered Web Components</h3>
        <p>Transform your website or application from static to dynamic with AI-powered interactive components. I can create engaging data visualizations that update in real-time, responsive design elements that adapt intelligently, or other custom AI-driven features that make your platform stand out. Let's build web experiences that are not just functional, but truly alive and intelligent.</p>
