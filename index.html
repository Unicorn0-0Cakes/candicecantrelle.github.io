                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Candice Cantrelle, a game developer and AI researcher specializing in using neural networks to enhance game design. 
                    With expertise in procedural generation, UI/UX design, and swarm intelligence, I create immersive experiences that push the 
                    boundaries of player interaction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm currently developing a suite of innovative Roblox games, including AI-driven simulations and engaging 
                    tycoon-style mechanics. My goal is to collaborate with forward-thinking developers and studios to create 
                    cutting-edge games that captivate and inspire.
                </p>
