# Work With Me

Transform your [client type] business into a predictable, scalable growth engine—without wasting time on tactics that don’t move the needle.

---

## Is This for You?

This is a great fit if you:

- Are an established [industry/niche] business with consistent revenue.
- Want a strategic partner, not just another freelancer or agency.
- Are ready to invest in systems that compound over time.

This is not a fit if you:

- Are looking for one-off quick fixes with no long-term plan.
- Are unwilling to implement recommendations or give access to key data.
- Want the cheapest option instead of the best long-term result.

---

## Start With a Quick Fit Check

Before we work together, complete a short, 60-second Fit Check to see which path makes the most sense for you.

> **Fit Check:** Answer 6 quick questions about your current situation, goals, and timeline.

## Your Options at a Glance

Below are three ways to work together, depending on how much support and implementation you need.

| Tier | Best For | Primary Outcome | Commitment | Investment |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Clarity Intensive** | Leaders who want a clear plan before committing to ongoing support | A prioritized roadmap and concrete next steps you can execute immediately | 1–2 weeks | Fixed, one-time fee (applied toward ongoing work if we continue) |
| **Growth Partnership** | Teams ready to implement and iterate with expert guidance | Ongoing strategy, implementation support, and optimization to hit specific growth targets | 3–6 month minimum | Monthly retainer |
| **Private Advisory** | High-growth leaders who want a strategic partner on call | White-glove, highly personalized advisory and oversight across key initiatives | 6–12 month partnership | Custom engagement, limited availability |

---

## Tier 1: Clarity Intensive

A focused, short engagement designed to give you clarity and a concrete action plan.

**What you get:**

- Pre-engagement questionnaire to understand your current state and goals.
- 1–2 deep-dive strategy sessions (live).
- A written roadmap outlining priorities, timelines, and recommended stack/process.
- Option to apply the full fee toward a longer engagement if we both agree it’s a fit.

**Ideal if:** You want expert eyes on your situation and a clear path forward before committing to a monthly engagement.

## Tier 2: Growth Partnership (Most Popular)

Ongoing, hands-on partnership to implement, refine, and scale.

**What you get:**

- Recurring strategy and implementation sessions (e.g., weekly or biweekly).
- Implementation support across agreed focus areas.
- Metrics tracking and regular reviews to keep everything accountable.
- Priority async support for questions and adjustments between sessions.

**Ideal if:** You want a partner to help you execute the plan, not just hand you a document.

## Tier 3: Private Advisory

A high-touch, bespoke advisory relationship designed for high-growth leaders.

**What you get:**

- Direct access via a private channel during business hours.
- Quarterly or monthly strategic planning sessions.
- Review of key decisions, proposals, and initiatives before they go live.
- Coordination with your internal team or other partners as needed.

**Ideal if:** You want a strategic partner embedded in your decision-making, not just periodic check-ins.

## How It Works

1. **Complete the Fit Check**  
   Share where you are now, what you want to achieve, and your timeline.

2. **Book a Consultation**  
   If there’s a fit, you’ll be invited to a consultation to review your situation and options.

3. **Start With the Right Tier**  
   We’ll agree on the best starting point—often a Clarity Intensive or direct entry into the Growth Partnership.

## Fit Check

Use the prompts below as your temporary “test” until it’s turned into a form/quiz:

1. What best describes your current stage?  
   - Early but stable  
   - Growing and hiring  
   - Scaling and optimizing

2. What is your primary goal for the next 6–12 months?

3. What’s your biggest current bottleneck?

4. How soon are you looking to start working with a partner?

5. Are you open to a minimum 3–6 month commitment for the right fit?

You can temporarily implement this as an embedded form (Typeform, Tally, etc.) and link the button above directly to it.
